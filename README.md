## Commands


The commands are designed for a qwerty keyboard but you can easily change most of them in the commands.xml (next to the .exe) if you respect the syntax. It also support an Xbox 360 controller.

### Keyboard + mouse

#### Special keys
* Escape: show the ingame menu or to close a menu
* F1: switch from debug camera mode to player view
* Ctrl: if in camera mode allow to use some commands as if we were in player view (i.e Ctrl + Numpad1 to dance)

#### Basic commands
* Look around with the mouse
* Move the camera and the character with the WASD keys or the arrows. In camera mode, use Q (or E) to move up (or down)
* Left shift to sprint

#### Character commands
* Left click for main action (open the GUI if on a construction block else depending on your select bar shoot or place a cube)
* Right click for secondary action (select a character or delete a block if no one selected)
* Mouse wheel to move the selector of the select bar
* Space to jump
* E: levitate
* I: open the inventory
* C: create an allied robot (need at least a Head Quarter and a Robot factory before)
* O: select all your allies then deselect all of them
* F: Order your selected allies to follow you then to stop following you
* G: Order your selected allies to attack the aimed ennemy if any in front of you else order to go to the highlighted block
* Numpad1: dance (go in camera mode to see him)

### Xbox 360 controller
The controller doesn't allow you to perform as much action as the keyboard + mouse commands. Basically you can't move the mouse or dance.

* Move with the left stick, look around with the right one. Press on left stick to sprint
* Start = Escape
* RT = main action, LT = secondary action
* RB (or LB) to move the selector on the right (or left) as the mouse wheel
* A: jump
* Y: levitate
* X: inventory
* B: create unit
* Up arrow: create unit
* Left arrow: follow order
* Right arrow: goto and attack order

## Known issues

* Load and save functions may crash
* Scenario menu doesn't open anymore
* Some GUI issues when the window is resized
* Mouse get blocked in fullscreen mode and thus can't completly move the camera around (no issues with the controller)
* The amount of block isn't removed after paying the cost for a building
* The inventory empties on island changement
* Collisions issues when walking on the snow
